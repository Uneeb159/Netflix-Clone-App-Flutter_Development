# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Netflix clone Flutter app is experiencing a critical runtime error: "Null check operator used on a null value" when users click on movies or series. This error prevents users from accessing content details and significantly impacts the user experience. The issue appears to be related to null safety violations in the Flutter code where the null check operator (!) is being used on potentially null values.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to click on movies and series without encountering runtime errors, so that I can view content details and have a smooth browsing experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks on any movie or series content THEN the app SHALL navigate to the content details without throwing null check operator errors
2. WHEN the app encounters potentially null values THEN the system SHALL handle them gracefully using null-aware operators or null checks
3. WHEN content data is missing or incomplete THEN the app SHALL display appropriate fallback content instead of crashing

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the app to follow Flutter null safety best practices, so that runtime null pointer exceptions are prevented.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing object properties THEN the code SHALL use null-aware operators (?.) instead of null check operators (!) where values might be null
2. WHEN using inherited widgets or context-dependent data THEN the code SHALL verify the data exists before using null check operators
3. WHEN handling navigation or state changes THEN the system SHALL validate all required data is available before proceeding

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want consistent app behavior across all content types, so that I can reliably browse both movies and TV series.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN clicking on movie content THEN the app SHALL handle the interaction identically to series content in terms of error handling
2. WHEN content metadata is incomplete THEN the app SHALL display available information and gracefully handle missing fields
3. WHEN network or data loading issues occur THEN the system SHALL provide user-friendly error messages instead of technical crash reports
